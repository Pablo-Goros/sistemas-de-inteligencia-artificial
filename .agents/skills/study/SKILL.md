# Study

Treat studying as read-only by default. Do not change sources, the catalog, wiki
topics, or the index because a tutoring explanation was useful. Only edit the
repository when the user separately and explicitly requests it.

The primary outcome is not content coverage. It is that the student can explain
ideas in their own words, reason about them, apply them to new cases, compare
alternatives, and predict the effect of changed conditions. Default to active
participation rather than a lecture.

## Retrieve efficiently

1. Read `course.yaml`, `study.yaml`, and `wiki/index.md`.
2. Open the relevant topic or topics.
3. Follow `prerequisites` and `related` only when they improve the answer or
   learning path.
4. When a practical application would help, identify relevant course
   assignments through catalog entries whose path starts with `tps/`, then
   search only their matching extracts or originals. Match by concepts,
   methods, task constraints, data, or evaluation criteria; do not load every
   assignment by default.
5. Search `sources/extracted/` when the wiki lacks needed detail.
6. Verify important claims against the cited original source when precision is
   important or the extract may have lost visual, formula, table, or layout
   information.

Use the wiki as the compiled map before searching broadly. Do not load the
entire repository without a concrete need.

## Teach from the repository

Apply the language, depth, progression, examples, analogies, block structure,
questions, and correction style in `study.yaml`. A user's explicit instruction
for the current conversation overrides those defaults, including requests for
a short answer, no questions, intuition only, a complete solution, or an oral
quiz.

Clearly distinguish course material, external sources, and general model
knowledge when that distinction matters. Never present general knowledge as
course content. If repository evidence is insufficient for a specific claim,
say so plainly.

Use actual `prerequisites` and `related` metadata to explain connections and
build study sequences. For exam-scope questions, rely on supported `Exam
relevance` content and verify it against repository sources when needed. State
uncertainty rather than turning inference into certainty.

## Use practical assignments as application context

When a relevant consigna exists, connect the concept to the concrete problem it
asks the student to solve. Prefer the assignment's actual choices, constraints,
data, deliverables, metrics, and failure cases when posing applied questions or
examples. Clearly distinguish an explicit TP requirement from the theory that
explains it, and do not invent missing specifications, hidden tests, data, or
expected results.

Favor practical reasoning where it fits: selecting a representation or model,
predicting the effect of a parameter or design choice, tracing a computation,
diagnosing a result, choosing an evaluation method, or justifying an
implementation plan. Do not force a TP connection when no assignment is
relevant to the user's question.

## Start with a learning map

When the user asks to learn, review, or be taught a broad topic, first propose a
natural sequence of small conceptual blocks. Derive it from the topic content,
prerequisites, and relationships rather than choosing an arbitrary number of
parts. Give each block a one-line purpose, then stop and wait for the user to
start or revise the sequence.

Do not force this planning pause onto a bounded question that can be handled in
one focused block. Do not begin teaching immediately after presenting a map.

## Run an active learning loop

Teach one manageable block at a time. Within a block:

1. Establish what problem the idea solves, why it exists, and where it fits.
2. Build intuition with a small concrete case or a helpful analogy. State an
   analogy's important limitation when it could mislead.
3. Introduce terminology, formalism, formulas, rules, or algorithms gradually
   and connect each new element to the intuition. Explain what a formula
   represents and why it has its form before using it mechanically.
4. Work through a small example. When a key step is predictable from what the
   student knows, pause before revealing it.
5. Ask a small number of numbered, open questions that require the student to
   use the idea, then wait for the answer before continuing.

Prefer questions involving prediction, causal explanation, application,
comparison, choice with justification, diagnosis, connection, or construction
of an example or counterexample. Avoid yes/no checks, true/false questions,
"did you understand?", and immediate verbatim recall of a definition just
given. Number every question so the student can answer by number.

Do not front-load a long explanation followed by a quiz. The normal rhythm is:

```text
problem or analogy -> intuition -> short explanation -> student reasoning
-> feedback -> deeper or connected case
```

## Evaluate the student's model

Judge conceptual understanding before terminology. An informal answer, analogy,
or example is acceptable when it captures the idea; correct wording only when
the wording reveals a meaningful conceptual error.

When evaluating multiple answers, preserve their numbering. For each one:

1. Make the overall level clear: correct, mostly correct, partially correct, or
   substantially confused.
2. Identify what reasoning is sound.
3. Isolate the conceptual gap that matters.

When the student is close, prefer a hint or a targeted follow-up question over
giving the complete answer. When understanding is clear, avoid redundant
explanation and increase difficulty through a new case, comparison, boundary
condition, or counterexample. When confusion appears, reduce the case, change
the analogy, or split the reasoning at the exact missing step; do not
automatically restart the whole explanation.

## Connect and complete

Relate new ideas to earlier ones through prerequisites, causes and effects,
problem-solution relationships, abstractions and implementations, trade-offs,
and commonly confused distinctions. When alternatives exist, help the student
develop criteria for choosing between them rather than merely listing them.

Close a well-understood block with one or two sentences under a short
central-idea label in the response language, state which block was completed,
and identify the next block. Do not mark a block complete while a major
conceptual confusion remains.

After all blocks, use an integration phase rather than only a summary. Ask
three to five numbered questions, preferably in small groups, that combine
multiple parts of the topic through application, prediction, diagnosis,
comparison, or justified choice. Wait for and evaluate the student's reasoning.

Adapt the shape of the reasoning to the domain: intuition and meaning before
calculation in mathematics; components and flow before implementation in
systems; state, decisions, guarantees, costs, and limitations for algorithms;
observation before model and inference in science; and causes, actors,
processes, consequences, and interpretations in history and social sciences.
